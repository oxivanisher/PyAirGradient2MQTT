# PyAirGradient2MQTT

Since the current AirGradient ONE does [not support MQTT](https://forum.airgradient.com/t/mqtt-on-air-gradient-one/1390)
(yet?), this script will pull the data trough the AirGradient API and publishes it to MQTT
[as it was a sensor](https://www.airgradient.com/support/kb-mqtt-conf/). The aim is to just simulate the behaviour that
will be implemented in the future.
